# Vibetuner

> Vibetuner is a production-ready FastAPI project scaffolding tool that generates full-stack web applications with authentication, flexible database support (MongoDB or SQL), frontend, Docker deployment, and CLI tools pre-configured in seconds. Built by All Tuner Labs for rapid iteration and modern development.

Important notes:

- Vibetuner consists of three packages: a Python framework (`vibetuner`), a JavaScript package (`@alltuner/vibetuner`), and a Copier scaffolding template
- The framework separates immutable framework code (`src/vibetuner/`) from your application code (`src/app/`) for clean updates
- HTMX is used instead of React/Vue for simplicity - server-rendered HTML with sprinkles of interactivity
- All tools are chosen for speed: uv (Python), bun (JavaScript), Granian (ASGI server), Ruff (linting)
- The project is designed to work excellently with AI coding assistants like Claude, Cursor, and ChatGPT
