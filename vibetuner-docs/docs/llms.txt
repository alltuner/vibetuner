# Vibetuner

> Vibetuner is a production-ready FastAPI project scaffolding tool that generates full-stack web applications with authentication, flexible database support (MongoDB or SQL), frontend, Docker deployment, and CLI tools pre-configured in seconds. Built by All Tuner Labs for rapid iteration and modern development.

Important notes:

- Vibetuner consists of three packages: a Python framework (`vibetuner`), a JavaScript package (`@alltuner/vibetuner`), and a Copier scaffolding template
- The framework separates immutable framework code (`vibetuner` package) from your application code (`src/app/`) for clean updates
- In all examples, `app` refers to your project's Python package (the directory under `src/`). The actual name depends on your project slug (e.g., `src/myproject/` for a project named "myproject")
- HTMX is used instead of React/Vue for simplicity - server-rendered HTML with sprinkles of interactivity
- All tools are chosen for speed: uv (Python), bun (JavaScript), Granian (ASGI server), Ruff (linting)
- The project is designed to work excellently with AI coding assistants like Claude, Cursor, and ChatGPT

## Features

- **CRUD Factory**: `create_crud_routes()` generates list/create/read/update/delete
  endpoints for Beanie models with pagination, filtering, sorting, and search
- **SSE Helpers**: `@sse_endpoint()` and `broadcast()` for real-time streaming with
  HTMX. Import from `vibetuner.sse`. Redis pub/sub for multi-worker support
- **Template Context Providers**: `register_globals()` and `@register_context_provider`
  inject variables into every template render
- **Service DI**: `get_email_service()`, `get_blob_service()`, `get_runtime_config()`
  FastAPI dependency wrappers
- **Health Checks**: `/health`, `/health/ping`, `/health/ready`, `/health/id` endpoints
  with service connectivity checks
- **Robust Tasks**: `@robust_task()` decorator with exponential backoff retries and
  MongoDB dead letter collection
- **Streaq UI**: Task queue monitoring dashboard at `/debug/tasks`
- **Doctor CLI**: `vibetuner doctor` validates project setup, services, and config
- **Config Decorators**: `@config_value()` and `ConfigGroup` for type-safe runtime
  configuration
- **Testing Fixtures**: `vibetuner_client`, `mock_auth`, `mock_tasks`,
  `override_config`, `vibetuner_db` pytest fixtures
- **Error Messages**: Actionable error messages with env var examples, Docker
  commands, and documentation links
