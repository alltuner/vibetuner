# Development Guide

The detailed contributor documentation now lives alongside the rest of the docs
site.

- **Working on the Vibetuner scaffold itself:**  
  See `docs/development.md` (rendered at `/contributing/development/` in the site).
- **Developing inside a generated project:**  
  Follow `docs/development-guide.md`.
- **Command reference:**  
  Consult `docs/cli-reference.md` and `docs/scaffolding.md`.

To browse the full documentation locally:

```bash
just docs-serve
```

That command rebuilds the MkDocs site with live reload at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.
